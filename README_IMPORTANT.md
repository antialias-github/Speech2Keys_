Speech2Keys_
============

Do NOT use "mouse-right-click save" to save the executable and dll to your desktop. 
This will result in corrupted downloads that will NOT work!
Use the 'clone to desktop' button on the right side instead!

Put Speech2Keys.exe and InputManager.dll in the same directory. Click on the exe and enjoy.
If it doesn't work drop me a line at 
speech2keys@gmail.com
